# Fishackathon 2018 "Visual Survey"

This project was done during Fishackathon in 36 hours as a solution for Challenge 2, which was Translation Services for Labor Inspections.
The problem was that the language barriers primarily in the Thai fishing industry were making it difficult for inspectors to efficiently record survey responses. Translators were needed to translate multiple languages such as Burmese and Lao and it was not efficient. They wanted a survey that can be implemented on mobile devices for workers to take.

The solution my partner and I implemented was a visual survey, using pictures to translate the sample survey that was provided from
the Environmental Justice Foundation. We designed, drew, and edited the pictures we created and used them as the questions. I wrote 
Java and XML code needed to create the Android app that implements the visual surveys we created on a survey platform. 

Due to time constraints, this app could be further improved and modified. Few of the quality of life issues that were brought up were: availability of offline mode, storing users responses and uploading to a database, and the survey platform. These issues could be addressed and improved upon in the future.
